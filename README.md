This is a note-book like app built for personal use. It is used specefically for keeping record of unwatched movies for a person. 
Three details of the movie are taken : 1) Title
                                       2) Director name
                                       3) Genre
                                       
By clicking on 'Add movie' button, a row is created containing all the three details mentioned above. 
In the right corner of newly created row, there is a button created which removes all the details of that movie. 
All the details are stored temporarily, so if page is refreshed, all details will vanish.
